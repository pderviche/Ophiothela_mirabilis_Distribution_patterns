Datasets and R codes of the paper Derviche P, Saucsen A, Spier D, Lana P, 2021. Distribution patterns and habitat suitability of the non-native brittle star Ophiothela mirabilis Verrill, 1867 along the Western Atlantic. J. Sea Res. 168, 101994

Not all scripts are available yet, but I will share it soon.

For now, the ENMs of the brittle star Ophiothela mirabilis are available. I will also share the ENMs of the host species, and the scripts of the predicted realized niche of the brittle star.
